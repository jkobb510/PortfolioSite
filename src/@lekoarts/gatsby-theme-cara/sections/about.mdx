## About Me

I have experience in building websites, using JavaScript (with Node.js and React) and HTML5/CSS3. I also have enjoyed the process creating mobile applications, having dabbled in Android development (with Android Studio, Java) and currently working as a freelance iOS developer, using Swift and XCode. 

On the back-end, I have used Firebase for storing data for authentication and querying user location, and also have used Amazon Web Services for EC2 Instances and currently plan to deploy a project with Elastic Beanstalk
